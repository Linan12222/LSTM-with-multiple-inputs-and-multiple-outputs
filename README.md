# LSTM-with-multiple-inputs-and-multiple-outputs
This is a project of wind speed prediction using LSTM with multiple inputs and multiple outputs with good prediction results. The keras version and the pytorch version obtained by modifying keras are included. It is used to compare with the original LSTM (r2 is negative).
