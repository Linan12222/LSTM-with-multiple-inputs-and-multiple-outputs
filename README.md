# LSTM-with-multiple-inputs-and-multiple-outputs
This is a project of wind speed prediction using LSTM with multiple inputs and multiple outputs with good prediction results. The keras version and the pytorch version obtained by modifying keras are included. It is used to compare with the original LSTM (r2 is negative).
Single-Step Prediction


2023.12.3 Update: Added multi-step prediction function.Setting seq_out_len controls the number of steps in the prediction.The model.py file is not needed, just run baseline_model.py.Only the pytorch version has been modified

2024.4.19 Update:The interval prediction function has been added and evaluated. Run only model.py.
